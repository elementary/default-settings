# Application configuration options
#
# NOTE: Having an entry here for an application with allowed=true means that
#       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to
#       ensure that applications with built-in authorization mechanism (e.g web
#       browsers) do not have to be bound to agents.
#
#       If your application is denied access to location information and your
#       operating system doesn't provide any mechanism to change that, it is
#       likely a bug in your operation system (or geoclue). The solution is to
#       report the issue with all details, rather than adding your application
#       to this list.
#
